# Griptape Docs

Welcome to Griptape Docs!

This documentation covers the fundamentals of the **griptape** framework and describes how to use **griptape-tools**.

## griptape

**griptape** is a modular Python framework for LLM workflows, tools, memory, and data that enables developers to:

1. ü§ñ Build **AI agents**, sequential **LLM pipelines** and sprawling **DAG workflows** for complex use cases.
2. ‚õìÔ∏è Augment LLMs with **chain of thought** capabilities.
3. üß∞Ô∏è Integrate other services and functionality into LLMs as [tools](https://github.com/griptape-ai/griptape-tools) (e.g., calculators, web scrapers, spreadsheet editors, and API connectors); run tools in any environment (local, containerized, cloud, etc.); and wrap tools with off prompt data storage that prevents LLMs from accessing your data directly.
4. üíæ Add **memory** to AI pipelines for context preservation and summarization.

## griptape-tools

**griptape-tools** is an official collection of tools built for **griptape**. You can run Griptape tools in **griptape**, [LangChain](https://github.com/hwchase17/langchain), or as [ChatGPT Plugins](https://platform.openai.com/docs/plugins/introduction). Griptape tools are a great way to start using Griptape to see how easy it can be to build applications that extend the capabilities of LLMs. If you have an OpenAI API key, you can be up and running in a few minutes with Griptape using our [QuickStart Guide](griptape-tools/index.md).
