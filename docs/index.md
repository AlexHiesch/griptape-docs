# Griptape Docs

Welcome to Griptape Docs!

This documentation covers the fundamentals of the **Griptape** framework and describes how to use **Griptape Tools**.

## griptape

**griptape** offers developers the ability to build AI systems that operate across two dimensions: predictability and creativity.

For **predictability**, software structures like sequential pipelines and directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) are enforced. **Creativity**, on the other hand, is facilitated by safely prompting LLMs with [tools](https://github.com/griptape-ai/griptape-tools) that connect to external APIs and data sources. Developers can move between these two dimensions according to their use case.
