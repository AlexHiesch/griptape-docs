# SqlClient

This tool enables LLMs to execute SQL statements via [SQLAlchemy](https://www.sqlalchemy.org/). Depending on your underlying SQL engine, [configure](https://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/20/core/engines.html) your `engine_url` and give the LLM a hint about what engine you are using via `engine_name`, so that it can create engine-specific statements.

```python
SqlClient(
    engine_url="sqlite:///:memory:",
    engine_name="sqlite"
)
```
