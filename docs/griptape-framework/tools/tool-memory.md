Tool memory augments activity inputs and outputs with storage capabilities. It's a way to keep any data generated by tools off prompt but still allow LLMs to operate on that data remotely. This is useful in the following scenarios:

* **Security requirements**: many organizations don't want data to leave their cloud for regulatory and security reasons.
* **Long textual content**: when textual content returned by tools can't fit in the token limit, it's often useful to perform operations on it in a separate process, not in the main LLM.
* **Non-textual content**: tools can generate images, videos, PDFs, and other non-textual content that can be stored in memory and acted upon later by other tools.

Here is an end-to-end example of how memory can be used in unison with multiple tools to store and load content:

```python
from griptape.memory.tool import TextToolMemory, BlobToolMemory
from griptape.structures import Agent
from griptape.tools import WebScraper, TextProcessor, FileManager

"""
Define tool memory for storing textual and
non-textual content.
"""
text_memory = TextToolMemory()
blob_memory = BlobToolMemory()

"""
WebScraper enables LLMs to web pages.

Here we wrap WebScraper's `get_content` activity
in the text memory. Any result from this
activity will be stored in that memory and the result
ID will be returned to the LLM.
"""
web_scraper = WebScraper(
    memory={
        "get_content": {
            "output":  [text_memory]
        }
    }
)

"""
TextProcessor enables LLMs to summarize and query text.

Here we wrap `summarize` and `query` methods with the same
text memory, so that those activities can access data
in that memory.
"""
text_processor = TextProcessor(
    memory={
        "summarize": {
            "input": [text_memory]
        },
        "query": {
            "input": [text_memory]
        }
    }
)

"""
FileManager enables LLMs to store and load files from disk.

Here we wrap the `load` activity with the blob memory
to load arbitrary files.

We also wrap the `save` activity with both memories to provide
that activity with access to both storages.
"""
file_manager = FileManager(
    memory={
        "load_from_disk": {
            "output": [blob_memory]
        },
        "save": {
            "input": [text_memory, blob_memory]
        }
    }
)

agent = Agent(
    tools=[web_scraper, text_processor, file_manager]
)

agent.run(
    "Load https://www.griptape.ai, summarize it, "
    "and store it in griptape.txt"
)
```
