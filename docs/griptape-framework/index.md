**griptape** is a modular Python framework for LLM workflows, tools, memory, and data that enables developers to:

1. 🤖 Build **AI agents**, sequential **LLM pipelines** and sprawling **DAG workflows** for complex use cases.
2. ⛓️ Augment LLMs with **chain of thought** capabilities.
3. 🧰️ Integrate other services and functionality into LLMs as [tools](https://github.com/griptape-ai/griptape-tools) (e.g., calculators, web scrapers, spreadsheet editors, and API connectors); run tools in any environment (local, containerized, cloud, etc.); use tools directly in **griptape** or convert them into middleware abstractions, such as ChatGPT Plugins, LangChain tools, or Fixie.ai agents.
4. 💾 Add **memory** to AI pipelines for context preservation and summarization.
