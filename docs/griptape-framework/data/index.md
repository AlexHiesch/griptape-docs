Griptape provides several abstractions for working with data.

**Artifacts** are used for passing different types of data, such as text, lists, and blobs, between Griptape components.

**Embedding drivers** are used to generate vector embeddings from text.

**Vector storage drivers** are used to store and query vector databases.
