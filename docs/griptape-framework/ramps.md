Griptape ramps are tool wrappers that handle data returned by tool activities. It's a way to keep any data generated by tools off prompt but allow LLMs to still operate on that data remotely. This is useful in the following scenarios:

* **Security requirements**: many organizations don't want data to leave their cloud for regulatory and security reasons.
* **Long textual content**: when textual content returned by tools can't fit in the token limit, it's often useful to perform operations on it in a separate process, not in the main LLM.
* **Non-textual content**: tools can generate images, videos, PDFs, and other non-textual content that can be stored in ramps and acted upon later by other tools.

Here is an end-to-end example of how ramps can be used in unison with multiple tools to store and load content:

```python
from griptape.memory.structure import ConversationMemory
from griptape.ramps import TextStorageRamp, BlobStorageRamp
from griptape.structures import Agent
from griptape.tasks import ToolkitTask
from griptape.tools import WebScraper, TextProcessor, FileManager

"""
Define ramps for storing textual and
non-textual content.
"""
text_storage = TextStorageRamp()
blob_storage = BlobStorageRamp()

"""
WebScraper enables LLMs to web pages.

Here we wrap WebScraper's `get_content` activity
in the text storage ramp. Any result from this
activity will be stored in that ramp and the result
ID will be returned to the LLM.
"""
web_scraper = WebScraper(
    ramps={
        "get_content": [text_storage]
    }
)

"""
TextProcessor enables LLMs to summarize and query text.

Here we wrap `summarize` and `query` methods with the same
text storage ramp, so that those activities can access data
in that ramp.
"""
text_processor = TextProcessor(
    ramps={
        "summarize": [text_storage],
        "query": [text_storage]
    }
)

"""
FileManager enables LLMs to store and load files from disk.

Here we wrap the `load` activity with the blob storage ramp
to load arbitrary files.

We also wrap the `save` activity with both ramps to provide
that activity with access to both storages.
"""
file_manager = FileManager(
    ramps={
        "load": [blob_storage],
        "save": [text_storage, blob_storage]
    }
)

agent = Agent(
    tools=[web_scraper, text_processor, file_manager]
)

agent.run(
    "Load https://griptape.readthedocs.io, summarize it, "
    "and store it in griptape.txt"
)

```
