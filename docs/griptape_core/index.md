Griptape is a Python framework that enables developers to write tools for generative AI middleware once and use it anywhere.

Griptape has three core components:

- **Tools**: call external APIs, access databases, and run arbitrary code or CLI commands.
- **Executors**: run your tools safely in any environment: local, containerized, or serverless in the cloud.
- **Adapters**: convert tools into underlying middleware abstractions, such as ChatGPT Plugins, LangChain tools, and Fixie.ai agents.
