griptape-flow is a Python framework for creating workflow DAGs and pipelines that use large language models (LLMs) such as GPT, Claude, Titan, and Cohere.

With griptape-flow, you can accomplish the following:

1. 🚰 Build sequential **AI pipelines** and sprawling **DAG workflows** for complex use cases.
2. 🧰️ Augment LLMs with **chain of thought** capabilities and integrate **external tools**, such as calculators, web search, spreadsheet editors, and API connectors via [griptape-core](https://github.com/griptape-ai/griptape-core).
3. 💾 Add **memory** to AI pipelines for context preservation and summarization.
